# Game Build Installation
Create a folder called `csz` inside Half-Life and copy these files to it.

## Condition Zero Deleted Scenes files
Copy the sounds from the czeror folder, as those files will not be available here.

The WAD files will as well not be included, as the sounds, copy the required WAD files from czeror.

## Maps
The maps will not be compiled and has to be manually compiled using J.A.C.K. The JMF files will be included under the `mapsrc` folder.
